# Task-Manager
Capstone Project Three Level One
## What this program does:

This is a *task manager program*, the **key** of this program is to **store** all the **tasks** of the workers in the files in an orderly manner, and **also** stores 
files of all the **workers**, their *name* and their *password* so that they can use the program to access what tasks are submitted to them. When the user is done with a task 
he/she can just submit that the task is done and the **program will store it** with the new *information*. The admin can **access all the tasks** to check if the tasks are done by deadline,
the admin will also be able to see **who the task was assigned to**. This program is a unique **control system** for both *workers* and *management*.

## Key aspects of the program (**Worker**):

* The program prompts the user with a **login**.
* The username and password must **correspond** to the **corresponding** username and password in the workers files.
* The user is then allowed to check **his/her tasks**:
  1. The taskname
  1. Date created
  1. The deadline of the task
  1. If the task is done (*Yes* or *No*)
* The user is allowed to edit his/her **task** by submitting if the task is **done** or **not**.
* The user can check what tasks of him/her are done.

## Key aspects of the program (**Management**):

* The program prompts the user with a **login**.
* The username and password must **correspond** to the **corresponding** username and password of the **admin**.
* The user can do the following:
  * **Register** a new user
  * Check **tasks** of a **specific user**
